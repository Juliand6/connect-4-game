        <h2>How to Play Connect 4</h2>
        <p class="instructions-paragraph">
            Connect 4 is a two-player game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7-column, 6-row grid. 
            The objective is to connect four of your discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
            Players alternate turns, each dropping one piece per turn. The game ends when a player connects four discs in a row 
            or when the grid is full. If no player wins, the game results in a draw.
